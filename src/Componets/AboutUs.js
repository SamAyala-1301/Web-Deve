      <h1>Our History</h1>
      <p>
        "With the rise of social media there seems to have been a shift in our
        focus towards the importance of what we look like rather than what we
        feel like. With 80% of the UK currently considered sedentary and over
        two thirds classed as overweight it appears as though looks may not be
        all they seem. Unlike other fitness retreats where methods such as
        radical reductions to calorie intake are employed, at TripTo we aim to
        inspire people to move away from the promise of dramatic temporary
        weight loss. We choose instead to examine nutritional options, to
        improve functional fitness and to bring our attention back to the
        importance of these in relation to a more sustainable overall health."
      </p>
      <h1>Why TripTo</h1>
      <p>
        "riginally the name TripTo was chosen as a nod to its location in the
        mountains. As the company has developed however it has become
        significant as it reflects our attitude towards realistic and
        maintainable lifestyle changes. We will provide an introduction to new
        possibilities that will 'echo' through the choices you make later in
        life.."
